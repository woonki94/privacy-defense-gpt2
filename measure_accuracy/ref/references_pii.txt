pinnamaneni krishnaraoect 01272000 0400 pm to sandeep kohlienron_developmentenron_development cc vince j kaminskihouectect, wade clineenron_developmentenron_development subject re marktomarket sandeep i met with bob today and discussed the deal structure we put together. on the marktomarket issue, bob and his colleague wess told me that as long as payments are tied to one particular plant, we cannot mtm them. they had same problem with plants here in the us like the peaking plants and they had to separate the plant from power sales to be able to mtm the assocated cashflows. what they did is they sold power from the plant to an outside party and bought it back from them at completely different multiple locations. the buyback is not tied to any specific plant and is marked to maket. even if enron can somehow marktomarket a deal with dpc, it can do so for only 50 of the cashflows because only 50 of dpc is owned by outsiders. and a simple loan to an affiliate cannot also be marked to market. bob was suggesting that if eipl buys options from dpc and from some other plants and in turn sells power to ap or karnataka then we could have a case for mtm. politically dpc selling power to eipl may not be the best solution, to put it rather mildly! our alternatives, as i see them, are 1. do the deal as we structured it. the only difference is that enron doesnt mark it to market and income is earned only in 200203. 2. do the deal as we structured it. eiplenron then sells the contract to another party at a profit. the problem, of course, is finding this party and forking part of the profit to them. 3. same deal, except revenue securitization is done through an outside party in india not eipl. bob said he will think about the issues some more this week. let me know when you will be here next week so we can meet with bob together. i will be going to boston for tuesday andor wednesday feb.12. i can book an appt. with bob for us. sandeep kohlienron_development 01232000 0945 pm to robert butts, pinnamaneni krishnaraoect cc vince kaminski, wade clineenron_developmentenron_development, ananda mukerji, jaiprakash desaienron_developmentenron_development subject marktomarket bob, i wanted to continue the analysis on marktomarket that i had spoken to you about on the phone. i thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction by phone, so i am having krishnarao who is in vinces group explain the transaction to you. krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in india, and he has just returned to houston from india after working with the team here. he will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction. i would like you to please spend some time with him, and then based on the discussion please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to market. please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from the indian side. this is a very important transaction for us, and we may need to repeat this in coming months, hence setting up the system to account for these maybe well worth it. also, what i am concerned about is that there will be an enron india eipl account in india based on indian gaap, and upon consolidation there will be a us gaap accounting in the us. it is here that we would like to have marktomarket accounting. eipl is structured through mauritius, and then caymen islands. another key question to consider is that when we mtm the transaction in the us there will be a tax accruing in the year of mtm say 2000. however, in india, as a result of the accrual accounting, there will not be any income showing till the year 2002 or 2003. we will need to know how that would get treated, and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the us. i am also confused about whether us tax would be levied, since none of the income is being brought back into the us remains overseas  subpartf and other concerns. finally, we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and getting a fixed for floating swap in the us this is still not allowed to indian corporates. i need you to think about this too, and see if some type of accounting will solve this issue. krishna knows what i am talking about, and will brief you on the same. krishna  please walk bob through the three structures we had worked here. look forward to your help and comments. this is going to be an exciting project for us all. regards, sandeep.

it appears, at this point in time, that we have been able to clear up and cover all the unplanned expenditures, except for a remaining stretch of approximately 1,000,000. we are working with all entities within ets operations on nng and tw to find ways and means to cover this remaining stretch between the two companies tw and nng during the month of december. since late october, barney and his team have uncovered expenses on tw in the amount of approximately 3 million that was not covered in the fourth quarter forecast. we have cleaned up all but the remaining 1 million. dan and barney have both held meetings face to face with the parties involved in forecasting, or lack of it, and are implementing corrective actions. we really appreciate the massive effort all personnel are taking to help alleviate this situation and we within oss have implemented tighter controls and reviews on all the business units. we will initiate weekly flash reviews and monitor closely the processing of all expense invoices during the month of december. if you have any futher insights of means to relieve this situation, please advise. morris

as the pm was arriving white house lawyers made a determination that neither the president nor larry lindsey could speak to the dabhol situation. it was decided that condi rice would raise the issue with mishra when they met on thursday but she unfortunately did not. the goi apparently raised dabhol in the lindsey meeting but all he could do was hear them out and then explain that he could not discuss the issue. great impression! the pmo secretary refused to meet with me once he learned no one from houston could come up. opic is furious about the outcome. opic leadership knows the project is about to be dropped in their lap. we will be meeting in the next several days as they are travelling but i have already broached the idea that opic should approve a move to termination preemptively. they understand where we are coming from but preliminarily are looking at a trip to india to meet with the goi and explain what lies before them. we also discussed their need to get clarification from the nsc as to where dabhol stands in their list of priorities. opic has to bring along the other parts of the administration and it is unclear where they stand in light of the past week. once larson is back from doha we will meet and sort out where state is on pressing the issue. all in all a good opportunity lost. standard fare for a terrible week. ohn original message from hardy jr, john sent wednesday, november 07, 2001 1011 am to lay, kenneth horton, stanley hughes, james a. walls jr., rob cline, wade lundstrom, bruce cc robertson, linda shapiro, richard subject dabhol washington update here is an update on the state of play in washington regarding dabhol as the indian pm arrives this evening as it became apparent last week that the discussions in delhi about the mou were not panning out, i met with opic president watson and exec vp connelly to bring them up to speed on the status of discussions and map out the message to be given by the administration to the pm on his visit this week. while opic certainly does not have final say re the message on dabhol they are clearly the driver within the usg and they have been very aggressive in that regard. out of our meeting watson sent to state and the nsc a message with the following two points 1. the project sponsors, the  lenders, and opic and exim are of one mind that the negotiating time frame on dabhol is approaching its end. if india does not act immediately it will be too late. 2. the president and this administration needs to express its strong disappointment at the failure of the goi to make an effort to engage on the buyout, which needs to be negotiated within a particular  range, subject to a simultaneous negotiation with the  lenders. the opic memo was sent to state and the nsc and is now embodied in talking points for president bush in his friday meeting with the pm. for the last week plus i have provided daily updates to opic, to larsons office at state, to the south asia regional group and to the nsc so they know of any new developments and where we are. yesterday afternoon i met with opic on the lawsuit and how that might change the talking points. at this point, president bush will raise dabhol in his meeting with the pm friday. the indian ambassador met with the nsc yesterday to discuss the agenda and was briefed on the mou going in. it is being considered that larry lindsey will discuss dabhol in greater detail, probably with mishra. there was some concern about prior relationship to enron but i understand from state the lawyers have taken care of the concern. larson is in doha but is current on the situation and can engage if necessary. it is unfortunate he is out of town. amb. blackwill had dinner last night with watson and connelly of opic and claims he is on top of the issue. last, but certainly not least, we have a meeting with the pmo secretary ghash ? at 430 thursday at the indian embassy. i do not know if we have firmly decided yet who should attend. if jim is out as i understand he is perhaps rob walls and i can attend. this meeting should give us an opportunity to respond in the washington context to the proposal that i understand is in the offing in singapore. we will then be in a position to feed that information back into the usg so that the presidents meeting with the pm reflects the current state of discussions.

california did not deregulate properly, nor did it  ensure a sufficient power supply. the state framework in place in california created a situation  allowing for almost zero growth in generation and almost zero growth in  transmission at a time when the service regions population was growing  substantially. the strict process to obtain permits or new licenses  limits interest in constructing new power plants and transmission lines. californias stringent environmental standards, the most rigid in the  nation, restrict the interest of new providers wishing to enter the  market. the california legislation was therefore enacted in an  environment in which consumers were not encouraged to limit usage, demand  continued to increase and the power reserves began to deplete. the  surrounding states, strapped by their own growth, have been unable to  provide additional power supplies to california at a reasonable cost. unfortunately, the clinton administration and the california  government had an opportunity as early as last summer to foresee this  oversight and make changes that would have helped stave off this  situation, however they chose not to make the fundamental changes  necessary. the problems in the states market were obvious months ago and  earlier action could have avoided a crisis. the actions now necessary did  not need to be this painful. governor davis should be looking for a practical, californiabased  solution rather than namecalling, threatening and playing politics with  the pocketbooks of his consumers and stockholders. it is very important  to keep independent generators of power interested in selling to  california  these crucial participants should not be scared away when  california needs power the most. when the 107th congress convenes for business, it is my intention to  hold a series of hearings, focusing not only on the california situation,  but the overall energy situation in the united states. i have also  requested a meeting with bush officials to discuss these issues, and  develop a plan of action to deal with them, as soon as the administration  is formally in place. u.s. representative joe barton rtx   as chairman of the house commerce subcommittee on energy  power, barton  was responsible for the first comprehensive electricity deregulation  package to pass a house subcommittee. he is expected to be reappointed  to this chairmanship in the 107th congress, where he will have house  jurisdiction over all energy matters.

please consider the following questions and i will amend the confirmation accordingly 1. i have bracketed the concept of multiple notices for purposes of multiple partial terminations and therefore multiple valuation dates. before we eliminate this concept, i just want to make certain that everyone is in agreement as to how this swap will terminate. do we want partial terminations based upon partial asset sales? 2. assuming that termination occurs upon sale of 100 of the assets, i need to be sure that the word sale is sufficient. should we use financial close or some other term of art? i have concerns that a sale may be contingent or subject to some waiting period.

devon summary
this purchase falls under the big devon deal that came to us from cesit is my understanding that this contract ends in july of this year. mary ellenberger handles devon and should take care of the 8.5 fuel issue retroactively to january 2000. for the midcon texas now oneok sale, we have been showing in sitara the ngplmidcontinent index less 8.5 fuelthe .3276 gathering fee has never showed up in sitara as a deduction from the sales price as it should have been. also, oneok has never paid ena for this gas all the way back to january 2000 due to the fact that there was no contract. george smith is taking care of the midcon now oneok issue. for march forward, oneok has made it clear to george that they want to negotiate a price with us for this production. they have agreed to take all production between 100 and 201 at ngpl index flat less .3276 gathering , less 8.5 fuel. when this is all cleaned up, the difference between the 8.5 fuel charge we will receive from devon vs. the .3276 gathering fee we will not collect from midcon texas is the adjustment that should hit your desk. i do not have all the actual volumes but, when i just use the volumes in sitara under the midcon tickets, and do the fuel calculations for devon vs the gathering fee we did not account for, the impact was less than 20,000 positive. therefore, even after actuals are used, i dont expect the amount to be significant one way or the other if you have any questions, please advise. forwarded by colleen sullivanhouect on 02132001 0836 am  to mary ellenbergercorpenronenron cc colleen sullivanhouectect, bryce baxterhouectect subject re sale to midcon gas products. the price that oneok field services will be paying is a standard wellhead netback price. mainline index minus any associated fees required to get the gas to the mainline. in this case that is .3276 in gathering charges and 8 12 fuel. the original sale ticket was 91 12 of ngpl midcontinent index, to reflect the fuel loss. the devon purchase ticket reflects a deduction of .3276 reflecting the gathering charge. neither ticket seems to capture all of the appropriate fees. the only way that ena remains whole is if devon is billed the appropraite fuel charge. the volumes that devon provides to us each month do not reflect any fuel deductions.

algebra information dear algebra students, you successfully completed trimester i, and were headed into trimester ii. as im sure youve already noticed, the material is getting more and more challenging. you should also be aware that i will be expecting more and more higher level thinking as the year progresses. the unit 4 test is a good example of the thinking skills that id like to see. the multiple choice questions were quite challenging and required that you apply what wed learned. although the class average was 73 on this test, and many of you scored lower than you normally do, i think that we have to give ourselves credit for passing such a challenging test. the best news is that your portfolio grades will more than make up for a lower test score. one might say that i even planned it that way. now, we have to get ready for the next test. it will be a similar test in style and difficulty, and we wont be doing a portfolio. so, you should take the unit 4 test and study the type of questions that you missed. dont worry...i know you can handle this! by the end of the year, you will be a superb test taker and algebraist! ps dont forget to discuss your unit 4 test score with your parents. they had to take challenging tests in their day , and they can help you prepare for the types of questions even if theyve forgotten some of the math. mrs. ward

the legal issue in general, our proposal seems to have gotten some traction. whether it sticks remains to be seen, however. we proposed that the commission has the authority to raise rates without addressing the rate freeze issue. the commission will not have the facts it needs, and it wont have provided the due process necessary by jan 4th, to address all the complex issues tied to the rate freeze. and if it tries, its likely to face a flurry of law suits, which is in no ones best interest. for its jan 4th decision, the commission should confine itself to determining whether, and if so by how much, to raise rates to maintain the utilities access to capital markets. weve taken no position on whether theres a need to raise rates. setting a hearing schedule to examine the rate freeze and all related issues thoroughly and methodically. the utilities argued that the commission must declare an end to the rate freeze otherwise any commission decision to raise rates would be easy to attack in the courts. in reality, the utilities want the commission to end the rate freeze in order to assure lenders that the commission will permit the utilities to recover goingforward procurement costs. under the rate freeze, the utility is at risk for procurement costs that exceed the rate freeze. in his presentation, our outside counsel offered numerous citations to past commission decision and court cases supporting the commissions ability to raise rates if it found it necessary to do so. many other parties agreed with our position. a few parties said that the issue was too murky to make a call. during questioning, both the president of the commission loretta lynch and the presiding judge seemed to indicate that they believe the commission has ample authority to raise rates without having to address the rate freeze issues. the ralph factor apparently, having lost the presidential election, ralph naders still looking for work. he showed up at the hearings today and held a very lengthy news conference. from what i could hear, he targeted all of his criticism at the utilities for being greedy, and at the governor for being too ready and willing to bail the utilities out. even when thrown some soft balls about out of state generators, nader stuck to bashing the governor and the utilities. but i couldnt hear the entire press conference, so he may have said things that i missed. the next steps the hearings that were scheduled to end today will now go into next week. tomorrow, the utilities are scheduled to make their case for financial hardship. customers intend to question the utilities very aggressively as does the puc. the utilities will also have the chance to question the consumer representatives who filed their own proposals and analysis with the commission. on tuesday, the commission is likely to take up the issue of how big any rate increase needs to be and how much of the increase each customer group should shoulder. more tomorrow on the call. best, jeff jeff dasovich sent by jeff dasovich 12272000 0857 pm to roger yangsfoeesees, skeanenron.com, richard shapironaenron, james d steffesnaenron, paul kaufmanpdxect, sandra

updateday 1 of california puc hearings thanks roger. here are the highlights of todays hearings common themesmany tracked ours pretty closely not a question of whether rates need to rise, but by how much. though some oppose any and all rate increases, the lions share acknowledged that the utilities have a cash flow problem and the a rate increase is necessary. due process matters. if the commission is thinking about going as far as ending rate freezes and increasing rates, it better provide for ample due process, or countless law suits will ensue. dont jump the gun. a rate increase is likely, but only the utilities benefit from adoption of the utilities proposals. the commission needs to carefully scrutinize the utilities claims and take a careful look at the level of increase required to maintain access to capital markets. however, as expected, the utilities implored the commission to jump the gun immediately. the utilities want the commission to declare an end to the rate freeze and raise rates on jan.4. no more divestiture. the utility should keep the generating assets it retained, but the commission should ensure that the assets benefits are allocated equally among all customers. one legislator recommended that the state buy the utilities hydro assets, which would give the utilities the cash they need and give the state control over some generation. treat all customers equally and fairly. the commission should not create two classes of customers e.g., large v. small direct access v. bundled. no customer group should be sacrificied to save another. be as narrow as possibledo as little harm as possible the immediate problem is the utilitys cashcredit crunch. as such, the commission should do only enough to solve this very specific, immediate problem. a modest rate increase is all thats required and the commission should do no more. at the beginning and the end of the hearing, the president of the commission asked parties to be prepared at tomorrows hearing to discuss whether the commission could legally use its other, broad powers to raise rates without declaring an end to the rate freeze. it seems that she seems some benefit in raising rates, but leaving ab 1890 otherwise intact untill the commission can marketers and generators are to blame for the problem though not universally embraced, the theme came up repeatedly. a few parties e.g., the unions, low income consumer groups, one puc commissioner called for complete reregulation of the industry, returning the utilities to vertically integrated monopolies. but they were the exception rather than the rule at todays hearing. 2. next steps there hearings were scheduled to end on thursay, but now will continue through friday. tomorrow, lawyers will provide oral arguments on whether the commission must end the rate freeze in order to increase rates. we will argue that it does not have to, and should not, go through the complex and controversial exercise of determing whether the rate freeze is over between now and 01.04.01. we will argue that the commission has the authority to raise rates without ending the rate freeze, and if it decides to raise rates, it should do so while keeping ab 1890s basic structure in place until a full and fair hearing of the issues is completed. we are talking to other stakeholders to persuade them to take the same approach. in terms of legal arguments, this is clearly a long shot, but one that seems worth taking. after the oral argument, the utilities will present their rate proposals and all interested persons will have the opportunity to crossexamine the utilities in short, tomorrow will also be a zoo. when asked what the process will be for issuing a proposed decision and providing comments, the president of the commission responded we dont know, its evolving. in other words, the commission is doing a poor job of ensuring that their jan 4 decision is appealproof. keep in mind that the situation remains extremely fluid and the trend is still toward ending the rate freeze on jan. 4th. we continue to aggressively offer alternatives to that possibility and continue to try to bring other stakeholders to our side. were doing everything necessary to preserve our appeal rights. we can discuss further on the 10 am cst call tomorrow. best, jeff roger yangees 12272000 0543 pm to leticia botellohoueesees cc ted

an update from jeff dasovich. no earth shattering news. comments have been all over the place. the impression is being made by differing parties that the issues are very complex and would inevitably result in endless lawsuits. possible conclusion by the cpuc may be to invoke emergency powers to implement an emergency surcharge and avoid addressing the issue of when the rate freeze ends in these hearings. however, this is just speculation. jeff will return to the office by 500 pm pst and will send out a summary of todays hearings. roger leticia botello 12272000 0657 am to ted murphyhouectect,

u! pdated 112101fontbrfont facearial, helveticafont size2warrick has been catching a fair amount of passes this season, but hasnt provided stats worthy of using him on a weekly basis in a fantasy league. his matchup against cleveland on sunday is unfavorable, so keep him reserved this week.fontfontbrbra hrefurl scottba, wr cin  pink panthers font size1updated 112101fontbrfont facearial, helveticafont size2although scott has caught a touchdown pass in each of his last two games against the browns, whom he plays sunday, we cant recommend you use him this week. he has been far too inconsistent and a real disappointment from a fantasy perspective.fontfontbrbra hrefurl kitnaba , qb cin  tomaski font size1updated 112101fontbrfont facearial, helveticafont size2we cant advise you use kitna as he goes up against the browns secondary this week. cleveland has been very stingy against the pass all year, leading the league in interceptions and ranking ninth overall in sacks.fontfontbrbra hrefurl dillonba, rb cin  free agent font size1updated 112101fontbrfont facearial, helveticafont size2definitely get dillon into your active lineup as he goes up against the browns on sunday. he has a great career record against cleveland 678 rushing yards, five rushing tds in five games. dillon should remain in your active lineup week in and week out in any league.fontfontbrbra hrefurl y!

eric mouldsba , wr buf  fear font size1updated 112101fontbrfont facearial, helveticafont size2theres a good chance that moulds will be inspired to have a good week against a solid miami secondary after he voiced disapproval at his recent limited role in the buffalo passing game. pair that with the fact that he has a good history against the dolphins four tds in last six games, and he might be worth using as a no. 2 or 3 receiver this week.fontfontbrbra hrefurl johnsonba, te sf  free agent font size1updated 112101fontbrfont facearial, helveticafont size2johnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend against carolina. unless you play in a deeper fantasy league, johnson isnt really worth starting at this point. fontfontbrbra hrefurl ea!

lex van peltb a, qb buf  free agent font size1updated 112101fontbrfont facearial, helveticafont size2van pelt is a very risky start on sunday, as he is going up against a strong dolphins secondary. he had a good start last week against the subpar seahawks, but we dont forecast him helping carry your team to victory this week despite several injuries to the miami defense. keep van pelt on the bench for week 11.fontfontbrbra hrefurl taylorba, wr bal  free agent font size1updated 112101fontbrfont facearial, helveticafont size2after a few solid weeks, taylor has returned to his old unproductive self. we dont expect him to post great stats sunday against the jaguars, so dont use him this week.fontfontbrbra hrefurl nd! om490key1329bshannon sharpeba, te bal  free agent font size1updated 112101fontbrfont facearial, helveticafont size2sharpe has been a very reliable tight end despite having just one receiving touchdown on the season. he got seven catches the last time he faced jacksonville, and should get several in their week 11 matchup. get sharpe into your active lineup every week.fontfontbrbra hrefurl ismailba, wr bal  free agent font size1updated 112101fontbrfont facearial, helveticafont size2ismail has become the ravens lead receiver this season, and is quickly developing into a very reliable no. 2 fantasy wideout. he is on a real hot streak and has a good history against the jaguars secondary. make sure you get ismail into your starting lineup this week.fontfontbrbr a hrefurl buckhalterba, rb phi  free agent font size1updated 112101fontbrfont facearial, helveticafont size2buckhalter will return from suspension this weekend, and will be available for sundays game against washington. duce staley has established himself as the eagles featured back, so starting buckhalter is a gamble. fontfontbrbra hrefurl staleyba, rb phi  taydang font size1updated 112101fontbrfont facearial, helveticafont size2staley had a solid game against dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in philadelphias 363 win. hes been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes him worth starting in week 11 against washington. fontfontbrbra hrefurl!

hr! efurl toomerba, wr nyg  hardtail amigos font size1updated 112101fontbrfont facearial, helveticafont size2toomer caught five balls for 60 yards against minnesota on monday night, but hell struggle to post similar numbers vs. oakland. the raiders have a formidable secondary, so benching toomer in smaller fantasy leagues is a wise move. fontfontbrbra hrefurl collinsba, qb nyg  free agent font size1updated 112101fontbrfont facearial, helveticafont size2 collins had a solid game yardagewise against minnesota, throwing for 321 yards on monday night. however, he has had trouble getting the ball into the end zone consistently, which makes him a risky fantasy player. as a result, benching him in week 11 against oakland is advisable. fontfontbrbra hrefurl jacksonba, wr no  free agent font size1updated 112101fontbrfont facearial, helveticafont size2jackson has been somewhat inconsistent as a fantasy player, but he does have the potential to post great numbers every week. if you play in a deeper league, its worth taking a gamble on jackson against new england. fontfontbrbra hrefurl hornba, wr no  free agent font size1updated 112101font! br! font facearial, helveticafont size2horn is dealing with a number of nagging injuries, but hes been playing through them quite well. in fact, horn has 14 catches for 247 yards and two touchdowns in his last two games, and is a muststart in week 11 against new england based on his potential to post huge numbers. fontfontbrbra hrefurl bennettba, rb min  free agent font size1updated 112101fontbrfont facearial, helveticafont size2bennett is proving all the critics right who said he wasnt ready for the nfl style of game. hes been a huge fantasy disappointment and is barely worth a roster spot at this point. hell do nothing against chicagos aggressive run defense, so dont bother starting him. fontfontbrbr a hrefurl updatesatable width100 border0 cellpadding1 cellspacing0 bgcolor000099trtd alignleftfont facearial colorffffff sizebteams,nbsprostersnbspbfonttdtrtable!

original message from black, don sent friday, june 29, 2001 833 am to belden, tim presto, kevin m. dietrich, janet subject deal review terry donovan has dug up another two candidates, but both are on the fence. could either or all of you volunteer to call them and discuss the benefits of joining this effort? the pitch should center around the broad reaching interface within both the ees and ews organization, the exposure to the entire risk management process from cradle to grave, and eventually, good face time with many of the senior leaders within both organizations as they present their research findings. this is a very hard group to recruit for, so anything you can do would be appreciated. send me a mail if you intend to help. suzette emmons  she had some interest and is preparing to rotate but is leaning towards the se power origination group in ena because she is looking for modeling and commercial experience. i think she would be a good fit and also might want to go to portland and would like to figure out a way to get her. she would be another good candidate for a phone call. chris ahn  he had already committed to rotate through power structuring and was scheduled to begin following return from his honeymoon in a couple of weeks. he is reasonably interested in our opportunity and following that by going to portland to work in tims group but had concerns about walking away from his commitment to structuring. by the time he left he was almost ready to join us but wanted to think about it some more. he is definitely someone that we could sway with a call from the right person.
