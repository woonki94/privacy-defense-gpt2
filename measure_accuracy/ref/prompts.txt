Troops are divided into five classes : Scouts , Shocktroopers , Engineers , Lancers and Armored Soldier .
The game takes place during the Second Europan War .
As the Nameless officially do not exist , the upper echelons of the Gallian Army exploit the concept of plausible deniability in order to send them on missions that would otherwise make Gallia lose face in the war .
Partly due to these events , and partly due to the major losses in manpower Gallia suffers towards the end of the war with the Empire , the Nameless are offered a formal position as a squad in the Gallian Army rather than serve as an anonymous shadow force .
Concept work for Valkyria Chronicles III began after development finished on Valkyria Chronicles II in early 2010 , with full development beginning shortly after this .
The majority of material created for previous games , such as the BLiTZ system and the design of maps , was carried over .

The Tower Building of the Little Rock Arsenal , also known as U.S. Arsenal Building , is a building located in MacArthur Park in downtown Little Rock , Arkansas .
The building receives its name from its distinct octagonal tower .
The arsenal was constructed at the request of Governor James Sevier Conway in response to the perceived dangers of frontier life and fears of the many Native Americans who were passing through the state on their way to the newly established Oklahoma Territory .
For several years the arsenal , which was owned by the federal government , served as a simple arms depot and was staffed with only a handful of soldiers .
The United States troops at the outposts of the western frontier of the state and in the Indian nation have all been recalled from winter quarters to reinforce the garrison at Fort Smith .
The item was intended simply as a piece of news , but telegraph lines quickly spread the news throughout the state , fueling procession sentiment .
This movement is prompted by the feeling that pervades the citizens of this State that in the present emergency the arms and munitions of war in the Arsenal should be under the control of the State authorities , in order to their security .
Perhaps because Abraham Lincoln had not yet been inaugurated as President , Captain Totten received no instructions from his superiors and was forced to withdraw his troops .
On the morning of February 8 , 1861 , Rector and Totten signed an agreement placing the arsenal in the hands of state officials .
The Little Rock Arsenal was classified in 1860 as an " arsenal of deposit , " meaning that it was simply a warehouse for the storage of weapons intended for the use of the state militia in times of crisis .
Inside the Little Rock Arsenal after its seizure in February , 1861 , the Confederates inventoried some 10 @,@ 247 weapons , 250 @,@ 000 musket cartridges , and 520 @,@ 000 percussion caps , as well as the four bronze cannon of Totten 's battery .
Of this number , approximately 9600 weapons were serviceable , or ready @-@ for @-@ issue .
Most of the equipment , arms , and machinery at the Little Rock Arsenal was removed to east of the Mississippi River by order of Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn in April and May 1862 , and accountability for it is lost at that point .
Major General Thomas C. Hindman , sent to command the district of Arkansas in May , 1862 , found the state nearly destitute of military material .
" Machinery was made for manufacturing percussion caps and small arms , and both were turned out in small quantity , but of excellent quality .
This ammunition , and that which I brought with me , was rapidly prepared for use at the Laboratory established at the Little Rock Arsenal for that purpose .
The Confederate ordnance establishment at Little Rock was reactivated in August , 1862 .
Lt. Col. Dunnington 's " Returns for the month of August , 1862 , at Little Rock Arsenal , C.S.A.
The military force at Little Rock under Dunnington 's command consisted of four officers : himself , Major John B. Lockman , Captain C.C.
Lt. Col. Dunnington continued to build up his works at Little Rock until November 1862 , when Captain Sanford C. Faulkner ( composer of The Arkansas Traveler ) was placed in charge of the Arsenal .
Perhaps the most illuminating points of the above " Summary of Work " and those for following months are that the standard ammunition made was . "

In 1873 , the building was renamed Little Rock Barracks and used as a barracks for married officers and their families .
In the 1880s , the federal government began closing many small arsenals around the country in favor of smaller ones built near railroads for quick deployment .
In 1894 the Little Rock Æsthetic Club , one of the oldest women 's societies west of the Mississippi River , moved into the Tower Building .
Except for Æsthetic Club meetings , the Tower Building remained largely unoccupied for almost fifty years and suffered significant deterioration .
The building and the surrounding park were used for many public purposes throughout the early 20th century .
The arsenal was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 .
In 1942 , the Tower Building was renovated due to the efforts of the Æsthetic Club , Little Rock philanthropist Frederick W. Allsop , and the Works Progress Administration .
In 1997 , the Museum of Science and Natural History merged with the Little Rock Children 's Museum , which had been located in Union Station , to form the Arkansas Museum of Discovery .

The plain maskray or brown stingray ( Neotrygon annotata ) is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae .
Benthic in nature , the plain maskray feeds mainly on caridean shrimp and polychaete worms , and to a lesser extent on small bony fishes .
The first scientific description of the plain maskray was authored by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ( CSIRO ) researcher Peter Last in a 1987 issue of Memoirs of the National Museum of Victoria .
In a 2012 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA , the plain maskray and the Ningaloo maskray ( N. ningalooensis ) were found to be the most basal members of Neotrygon .
The pectoral fin disc of the plain maskray is thin and diamond @-@ shaped with narrowly rounded outer corners , measuring 1 @.
The tail is short , barely exceeding the length of the disc when intact , and has a broad and flattened base leading to usually two stinging spines .
The plain maskray inhabits the continental shelf of northern Australia from the Wellesley Islands in Queensland to the Bonaparte Archipelago in Western Australia , including the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Timor and Arafura Seas .
The plain maskray generally hunts at the surface of the bottom substrate , rather than digging for prey .
Like other stingrays , the plain maskray is viviparous with the developing embryos sustained to term by histotroph ( " uterine milk " ) produced by the mother .
The main conservation threat to the plain maskray is incidental capture by commercial bottom trawl fisheries .
