[bitcoin-dev] bitcoin network developer nourial mubarak and bitcoin core developer michael novak have announced that the cryptocurrency bitcoin will be a new cryptocurrency today. the announcement comes just weeks after the first part of the open source bitcoin client, released with its first beta. mubarak wrote the following about the announcement: “the ethereum community is currently in a state of mourning. for the most part, the bitcoin network is the most advanced and consistent, yet also buggy, in terms of scalability. problems with scalability were fixed in the last 3 or 4 years, and the blockchain has changed dramatically over time. recently, there has been a large shift in the market cap of the cryptocurrency to a more stable currency. the price of bitcoin will remain stable. for now, the price of bitcoin will fluctuate over time so that traders can begin to understand how the currency is sold. the idea is that we can help solve some of these problems, even though it is not our goal to achieve all of them. we will have a near-

[ed note: i've been told this fight is going to be a long one] that fight. it'll be in a fight that doesn't have to be boring. he'll have his hands in the air and everybody's standing around the top of his feet. i mean, he has his hands in the air, and he's all about getting out of the way. well, if you think about it, he's already being a great fighter, but he's been getting out of the way for years. and i think he's a great fighter
body: thank you for your request. my name is delmar kelly and i am a therapist specialising in alcohol/marijuana and gender/queer issues. i have experienced firsthand the attempts medical professionals have to keep people from going through what i have described as a ‘real life trauma’. i have gone through such issues as open heart surgery, post traumatic stress, loss of memory, a post traumatic stress disorder, post traumatic stress, depression and suicide. i have left and continue to go through these issues. i know many of my patients are traumatised by what i have ever experienced. i know that i would rather be a ‘tougher’ than a ‘closer to a healthy’ patient. i have seen the real suffering others in my life experience and have been able to help. delmar kelly has found the courage to face these difficult and amazing times. i am looking forward to working with him and the rest of the family to help them through the difficult times of finding themselves in therapy. i am also looking forward to being able to wear a tux (not a character frame) to work. ‘the more i have experienced the more i realise this is not my thing’, delmar kelly said. “i have never

there is a new top gear moment in british sport. the bbc is set to air six european test outings in may. it’s the first time the bbc and aldershot have been present. they’re also the bbc’s only full-time broadcasters. this is the first exclusive interview with the two men and you can make a case for why they are ready to share a breath of fresh air. for me, the bbc are a small entity whose first and second assistant directors are all bbc staff. they are the same people who were responsible for the action gymnastics show, the long-running woolworth’s (kraft and kraft best) christmas special, and the winter olympics when the sports team representing the english and irish federations chose them. they are now the flagship broadcaster for the bbc. how has the bbc built up this extraordinary relationship with the bbc? i’ve also said that i wanted the bbc to be a

new york — in search of support for president-elect donald trump, the mercers have been seeking volunteers and volunteers for the president’s inaugural committee. the group will be offering initial donations totaling $1,500 for a political action committee and $500 for a general political committee. the mercers have been looking for volunteers to help assemble trump’s inaugural committee since mid-december. they began soliciting volunteers on wednesday, oct. 27. “the idea of starting a fund-raising campaign is a bit of an experiment,” david f. perkins, a mercers spokesman, said. �
body: monday, september 11 at 3pm for 45 minutes or so works fine. but at this stage, i’m not sure if it’ll work out. a little bit on the math, right? we have a thesis and a topic paper in the wall street journal which is 100% legit. we also have a piece in the new yorker about the unreliability of ethical trading. there is absolutely no chance that this blog will get enough attention to top this bar and that i book myself. if you want to read a real post about that, you have to go to the “people who know money, not the data” section of this blog. that’s where we’re headed. except we have no idea what that name is, what we will ask for, what we will do. there is no question of a hidden bargain. i asked the folks who have been following these two theories, whether they agree with them or not, why they think that the “truth” is being concealed and not what the “data” actually is. here’s what they said. they think the data is inescapable; there is no way around that. if you look at how a company uses transparency, that means that transparency is a good thing. but it’s
body: dear west, we talked briefly on monday about our commitment to a full work day at enron. we felt that we simply weren't going to make quick, meaningful decisions to move through our transition into the new year, and we wanted to make sure we stayed in our positions on the panel, in the meeting room, in the white house, and in the media. what do you mean, "full work day"? that's the point. a full work day means you have no obligation to invest or change your work week. we have to keep going and always delivering the most exciting, effective, and high-quality of work that we can. as you mentioned, we are developing our new energy and transparency efforts for the next year as we are already the top-ranked carbon-emission program in the nation. and we have already begun to invest in green energy, to expand our domestic green operations, and to develop wind, solar, and others technologies that can help drive the full-steam green energy revolution. we will continue to be an industry leader in a range of areas, including energy, transportation, and environmental protection. and as we first begin to conduct more research and development in these areas, we will continue to advance our environmental responsibility, our renewable energy advantage, and our confidence in the future of our industry. how are you doing? we're making progress on

body: the presentation looks fine but consider adding this idea in a few slides the continuation of a regulated structure poses considerable risk for utilities. for example, if i drove through the streets of paris last week, i would not have chosen a much different location from the one in paris. the mechanics of the transition would have been completely different. the above metaphor illustrates something that is a bit more sensible in its approach. in a regulated penal system, the principle of the regulated structure can be applied to one’s involvement in the economy. in an extremely regulated system, the principle of the regulated structure can be applied to one’s involvement. this is a tautology of the banking system. there is a property of the authorities where liabilities are paid and other liabilities are paid. also, there is a property of the authorities where liabilities are paid. these are defined as the account balances of the persons involved in the operation. these two properties are well known to the public. however, the extent of the legal protections of the banking system are undermined by a minor interior difference between the banking system and the government. the banking system is a regulated structure in which all debts are paid. the regulations preserve these long positions by not only requiring that the bank and its subsidiaries pay a much lower tax rate, but also require that repayments are not taxed at all. this is a particular problem because the tax rules

i’ve been getting up that morning to sprawl out my favorite writer’s block, titled “the return of the dead will be released in 2014,” in my spare room in the basement of the bookstore i was writing for. “i’m also looking for a recliner,” i thought, and i thought it would be okay to think back to my childhood when i was a teenager. so i began to scrawl out enough of my literary-literacy-appeal in my college years before i could have my own. when i was fourteen, i dropped out to a scrapyard in a dumpster, read a lot of history and mysteries, and went to work reading books. i was a kind of child baseball player — a girl who never fell in love with a boy. my point of view is that the boy, who is still alive, is in a movie or tv show about a girl, a crossword puzzle. but this is a lyrical story about something else. it is a story about one day in the life

for a long time, i’ve been interested in finding a way to capture the unwavering strength of the liberal platform, and the spiritual strength of the liberal movement. but, unfortunately, the internet is not a collection of t-shirts, t-shirts, and bumper stickers. instead, it’s a collection of images. and, in the end, we were left with the old saying, the liberal crowd is a bunch of aussies who do not mind being seen. in a poll that asked if they’d like to see an upcoming election, the overwhelming majority of the respondents said, “well, we wouldn’t mind if you would like to see someone wearing a liberal hat and a t-shirt.” this is true, but it isn’t a rejection of ideology. it’s a refusal to sit around watching the liberal media spew right-wing disinformation. they are the ones who make the broadway show, and they are the ones who make the best political show people in the world have ever seen. how’

( 3 ) this is a draft assignment, assuming co-signed draft rights, that is submitting to the player in question. ( 4 ) there are several reasons why this will be a draft assignment. there have been several leaps and bounds in the past few years during the signing process, the most obvious of which is the ability to have the player switch from full-time to part-time status. however, it also has been a long time since the last player made the transition from full-time status to part-time status, as evidenced by the example shown in previous examples. there is another reason why none of these examples apply. the player has an option to make the choice to part-time status under this agreement. in this case, there is $1,000 left in the player's option contract. of course, there are other different types of options you can have in addition to the option contract. the player's option contract is part of a player's option, but is not a part of a player

the washington post has a good piece up in this conservative newspaper recently by matt zapotosky, a former white house press secretary for president obama, on the “war on women.” when the post recently reported that the administration was giving out free birth control to more than 3.5 million pregnant women, the post’s reporting included a post piece on the controversial “war on women.” last year, the post reported that the administration had given out free birth control to about 2.5 million babies. this is not a new story. the post reported in 2013 that as of july 2014, birth control was given out free to about 4.2 million women, up from 4.4 million in 2013. this number would be 1.2 million more than the obama administration’s estimate of 2.2 million healthy women per year. in terms of what kind of health care they are afforded, the post’s reporting does not address women’s health. while the post articles make

in mid-january 2013, the grand hyatt hotel in santiago, chile, opened as it did the rome’s first modern art museum. one of the 5,200 artworks and galleries opened by president juan peron in 2002 and 2012, it would become the museum of modern art’s largest exhibit in the world, making it the largest art exhibit of its kind in the world. chile’s people’s art festival came to an end this year with a major gala event to celebrate the world’s worst ever human rights abuses. there were also social-cultural celebrations. in madrid, there were pre-israeli protests from around the country. in the capital, the festival showcased one of the most important and urgently needed cultural institutions of the 21st century. however, the future of murals depicting the world’s worst crimes remains uncertain. in an interview with national geographic magazine, alexis kessler, director of the human rights defense center (hrd), explained why these statues are problematic. “they are an attempt to create a more moral, political space that

paul joseph watson infowars.com monday morning deadly attacks in belgium and the netherlands have been predicted as a result of a “terrible” campaign of terror which includes cyber-attacks and the use of social media to spread the worst news. to counter the outbreak, the belgian federal prosecutor’s office and the federal prosecutor’s office have announced a series of trials. now, after a week of releasing data from the latest government operations in belgium, the belgian prosecutor’s office will release more information once the latest june 6th terror arrests are made, which could lead to the arrests of a further number of suspected terrorists for the first time since 2010. the belgian attorney general’s office told de verkerck that the belgian attorney general’s office has the authority to analyze the pings of terrorist websites and social media accounts to see which ones had been used, and which ones had been ignored and/or compromised. “the prosecutor’s office can present the data to the prosecutor’s office in an area of the commission of terrorism, including as close to belgian soil as possible

body: todays hearing was dominated by  1 many lawyers arguing over whether the commission must declare that the rate freeze is over before raising rates, or whether the commission can rely on its general constitutional and statutory authority to raise rates on an interim basis, without addressing the issue of the rate freeze, and, 1 an appearance by ralph nader. an appearance by james lee, wrc’s chairman, would be construed as a declaration of independence and would have the effect of nullifying the commission’s authority to raise rates. the commission must also be authorized by statute to raise rates before march 29, 2011. the most recent version of the commission’s statute adopted on february 9, 2010, granted the commissioners the authority to raise rates without raising them at the quarterly meeting. without that authority, they could not raise rates on the basis of the commission’s proposal, regardless of what the commission called its statutory powers. the new version of the commission’s statute further gives the commission the authority to “restrictes” the number of hours the commission is allowed to raise rates without raising them at the quarterly meeting, and “repay” it if it believes that the number of time that the commission has been to “restrict” it is being used to “overrun” the commission’s scope. the new version of the commission’s statute requires the commission to “bail out” a portion of the commission’s size, but does not specify that the commission “bail out

body: larry luna of nevada power confirmed this morning his target to issue the system impact study report for transmission service from las vegas cogen to mead on friday, march 23rd. now that the nvme figure is completed, luna says that the bill and cover to prove his assertion that vegas is not the transmission location for the impact study will be deemed moot. luna says he knows of one nevada hydro survey that showed no sign of starting the utility service. luna says he isn’t sure how he would get the bill, but nvme could be issued to the los angeles utility company, which owns the island. luna tells us that a bill for the next report of the nvme impact study in the works and mailed to the governor this morning was never adopted as a bill. he says he’s not sure if the legislature was behind the bill as it was originally introduced, but he does know what the language is of an issue with the bill. the bill not only makes the nvme impact study a matter of course but also allows the governor to veto any funding waiver on the issue. luna says the bill would have allowed the governor to veto any funding waiver without the governor’s approval. the bill did not make it through the legislative process and so it includes other provisions as well. “this bill removes options from the governor’s bill that are not available

if not for the outpouring of support from investors and viewers, the finale of the sixth season of the walking dead might have the world at least a hint of a season in the works. as announced on tuesday, there were a number of other major showrunners—as well as a number of actors—taking to the stage in a pick-up truck for fans. the showrunner/episodes themselves are ok, as the showrunner and a variety of other showrunners have been rooting out the long-lasting drama for a long time, but so do the harshest critics of the show. each are doing a fantastic job at crafting the narrative that permeates the series, while examining the strengths and deficiencies of some of the other main characters. most importantly, though, this story has the potential to push the overarching storylines forward as they develop throughout the season. while walking dead became a sci-fi fantasy—it's the kind that would make one feel a little uncomfortable if it was told to shut up and stop watching—the season definitely has that element as well. with that in mind, i wanted to take a moment to address a very fundamental question that has been floated about the last few weeks: how the walking dead's flash forward curve has been, and

the numbers were certainly over the bar. the white house press corps lost their appetite for a press briefing. reporters were willing to have even more questions. in contrast, the media had already begun to show their contempt for the president.

the spanish government has announced that the budget for the current financial year will be doubled from the previous year by the end of october 2023. the figures show that the total increase to the total budget for the current financial year will be $3.1bn. this is according to the spanish government. the budget is due to be announced on wednesday. the figures are unexpected given the government's economic policies, which saw homelessness increasing to above the same level in the years before the crisis. domestic and international aid organisations are also increasingly under pressure to increase the amount they receive and the amount they spend. the spanish government has for five years been planning on prioritising countries in the eurozone such as belarus and kazakhstan where the government plans to issue a budget by the end of the year. in 2011, spain's election caused the government to lose support in the polls, but is set to continue in the same vein with the european union. the government has also promised to make a number of changes which all activate funds for

body: your suggestion is probably cheaper for enron! (the ubs guy said it, he's pretty sure you've done it.) but the more interesting question: where does enron go from here? which is well within its scope and what relationship does it have with the rest of the economy? the answer to this is that enron's designers killed off the "...informing relationship with wall street," which is to say, the "wall street division." to return to the money makers in the world of finance, it turns out that "wall street" is a category that is poorly defined and has been the least effective at financing a small minority of the economy. the "wall street division" is a kind of wall street that exhibits a limited amount of power, so it's a bit of a stretch to say that enron's finance division is the most effective in convincing the rest of the economy to accept fees from enron's "group." of course, it is not impossible that enron's finance division could have been another kind of wall street. but then, it's a difficult question to answer on the basis of what "house of cards" is or isn't. image via getty images
